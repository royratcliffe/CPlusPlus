// This header defines the pure C++ public interface; notice there are no
// includes hence no other dependencies. Any general C++ translation unit can
// see this interface declaration without baulking. It contains nothing about
// Objective-C or Objective-C++. Such dependencies appear at link- and run-time,
// not at compile-time. This is by design. You can include this header in any
// C++ source.
//
// Semantically, the c_plus_plus_retained class is no retain count. It remains
// initially invisible respecting retain-release memory management. This changes
// when you retain it for the first time. At that point, you no longer delete
// the object. You must release it, doing so manually or by auto-releasing.
//
// Note, the struct cannot belong to a name space. Structs are classes. The
// difference is only one: the initial visibility; public for struct, private
// for class.
//
// Beware the C++ copy constructor! By default the compiler supplies a bitwise
// copy that copies everything verbatim. If you create a copy however, the
// duplicate has no retainer. If you want duplicates to retain then invoke
// retain(). If you want duplicates to auto-release invoke
// retained->retain().autorelease() assuming "retained" is a pointer to
// c_plus_plus_retained or its sub-class.

		// Answers the Objective-C retainer object. You can access the retainer
		// if you want in order to add the retained C++ object to a collection
		// such as an array. You cannot add C++ instances directly to
		// NSArray. But adding the retainer instead retains the C++ object
		// indirectly. Answers a void pointer to avoid polluting C++ namespace
		// with Objective-C artefacts. Cast the answer to "id" type under
		// Objective-C.
	
private:
	// Why void pointer? Why not CPlusPlusRetainer pointer? The design aims to
	// clearly separate C++ from Objective-C++. The two halves of this equation
	// should never meet except within the implementation, never within the
	// interface. Simple reason, the header becomes included by standard C++
	// translation units. Includers do not want to convert C++ sources to
	// Objective-C++ sources, cpp to mm. That would be an unnecessary
	// burden. Nor would developers want to deal with compiling as Objective-C++
	// despite the standard extension. Too messy. Better to keep the
	// implementation separate. Hence, only the linking phase has Objective-C++
	// dependency. Compiling remains agnostic.
